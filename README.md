# face-recognition-exp
This is an experiment I created in MATLAB to see if individuals who tried to remember a set of faces would also be able to 
succeed in a follow-up experiment, where a word list is shown, and then they are tasked with remembering, from a new list 
of old and new words, whether the word in the new list has been studied or not.
